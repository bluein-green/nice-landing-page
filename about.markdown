Hi, I'm Minjia! I'm from Singapore and once upon a time I lived in Sweden for 5 months as part of an exchange programme. 

One of the things that wowed me when I first went there is the variety of apples - beyond your regular Fuji apple, granny smith and royal gala apples that you'd regularly see in an NTUC. This website is to record the types of apples I tried and my thoughts on them :)
